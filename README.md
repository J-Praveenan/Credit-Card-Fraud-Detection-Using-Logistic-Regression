# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Logistic-Regression

## Overview

This project aims to develop a credit card fraud detection system using logistic regression. The goal is to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions based on various features associated with each transaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It consists of 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are fraudulent. The features in the dataset are numerical and have been anonymized due to privacy concerns.
